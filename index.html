            <section>Marvel Comics began life as "Timely Publications" in 1939, with comic books 
                featuring Captain America, Namor the Sub-Mariner and an early version of Human Torch.
                Legendary comics writer Stan Lee was hired as an office assistant in 1939. Within two
                years, the 19-year-old Lee was promoted to editor of the Marvel Comics line, a post
                that he would keep until 1972.
                Everything changed in 1961, when Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby ushered in "The Marvel
                 Age of Comics" by creating The Fantastic Four which brought a new style of superhero
                  comic that focused on the characters' internal drama as well as their heroic adventures
                  . The style was a huge success, and the Lee/Kirby team went on to create the Incredible
                   Hulk, Iron Man, the Mighty Thor, the X-Men, the Avengers, and the Inhumans. The 
                   prolific Lee worked with artist Steve Ditko to create Marvel's greatest success story,
                   Spider-Man. Stan Lee's Marvel revolution extended beyond the characters and storylines
                   to the way in which comic books engaged the readership and built a sense of community
                   between fans and creators.
                   Marvel Comics have been translated all over the world, and in many languages, most notably
                   in Europe (Arédit and Marvel France imprints) and Québec, Canada (Éditions Héritage).</section>
